1.1:
* SyncTeX support when using Evince (2.32)

- Doesn't support whitespaces or non-ASCII characters in filenames

* Jump to a BibTeX database (gb) from the manuscript.

- Looks at the <cword> variable under the cursor

* Improved BibTeX handling: 
- Databases in the compilation directory take precedence.

* Omni-completion () of fonts and pictures.

- font completion works with fontspec command \setmainfont
- picture completion works inside \includegraphics command
- supported formats: png, jpg, eps and pdf

1.1.6:
* The value of `makeprg' no longer interferes with other languages.

local to the LaTeX buffer for the same reason as above.
* Snippets now work when you have a BibTeX and a LaTeX file simultaneously on the buffer
list.
* Code clean-up.

1.2
* The value of `maplocalleader' is not changed if defined already by the user.

* Check included files for label completions.
* Deprecate automatic delimiter completion: it should be a separate plugin.
* TODO: make as g:tex_flavor.
* Lazy-load BibTeX completions: speeds up startup
* Handle complex LaTeX projects with multiple files gracefully: compilation,
    viewer launching, SyncTeXing.
